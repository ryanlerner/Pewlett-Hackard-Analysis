# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
  The purpose of this analysis was to create an additional two tables for Bobby. The first would be a summary of the number of retiring employees per title, and the other table was meant to identify the Pewlett Hackard employees eligible for a mentorship program. The mentorship eligiblity table lists the employee numbers, names, birth-dates, hiring dates and title.
