# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
  The purpose of this analysis was to create an additional two tables for Bobby. The first would be a summary of the number of retiring employees per title, and the other table was meant to identify the Pewlett Hackard employees eligible for a mentorship program. The mentorship eligiblity table lists the employee numbers, names, birth-dates, hiring dates and title. 
  
  ## Results
  
  The table displaying the number of retiring employees with their position titles can be seen here: [retiring_titles.csv](Data/retiring_titles.csv)
  
  The mentorship eligiblity table can be viewed here: [mentorship_eligibility.csv](Data/mentorship_eligibility.csv)
  
  ### Major points from these tables
  - From the retiring titles table, the most number of employees eligible to retire comes from Senior Engineers, who make up about a third of this list. Senior Staff also makes about a third of retirees.
  - Given that these two positions take up 2/3 of the eligible retirees, Pewlett Hackard will need to prioritize these roles when considering replacements for potential retirements.
  - There is a total of 90,398 employees in the retiring_titles table that are eligible to retire. 
  - However, there are only 1,549 employees listed in the mentorship-eligibility table. In order to properly account for replacing the retired employees, we might need to expand the criteria for potential mentors. The company would need to ensure they have an efficient system in place to cover the disparity between the number of people retiring and those who can fill these senior positions.
